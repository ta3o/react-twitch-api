I made this as a starting point, so you can get an idea of how to use the twitch API with React. It’s a work in progress. Feel free to send a pull request if you want to improve this repository.

If you need help, here is the official documentation of the additional technologies used in this example:
- Razzle ([https://github.com/jaredpalmer/razzle](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/razzle))
- Koa ([https://koajs.com/](https://koajs.com/))
- Styled Components ([https://www.styled-components.com/](https://www.styled-components.com/))
- Apollo ([https://www.apollographql.com/docs/](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/))

I recommend installing this tools if you are working with React, GraphQL and Google Chrome:
[React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi)
[Apollo Client Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/apollo-client-developer-t/jdkknkkbebbapilgoeccciglkfbmbnfm)


### Quick Start
- Clone the repository
- You must place a twitch client id in .env.development and .env.production (get your client id here: [https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api)). If you can’t get one, you can use mine "wj6248liq99xdl2u8n9hp9a8wejhbc" (without the "").
- npm install
- npm start
